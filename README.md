# PasswordGenerator

The Password Generator is a tool written in JavaScript.
It makes strong and random passwords according to what the user wants, like how long the password should be and what types of characters to use. 
It mixes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to make sure the passwords are hard to guess. 
Users can get a new password by clicking a button, and they can easily copy it to their computer's clipboard. 
This helps keep their online accounts and applications more secure and makes things easier for them.
